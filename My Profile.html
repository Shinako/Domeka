<p>My name is Miya Ford and I'm the older sibling of two.I am an artistic and talkitive person.I love to cook and eat equally.My favorite thing to do is read manga and watch animes that have just updated.</p>
<p>My brother's name is charile and he is into music and singing.I love to think about stuff, things that most people don't take the time to think about,such as the meaning of life and if all religions in existence are all part of one large truth making everyone right yet wrong.I have a short attention span,but chaile manages to keep my interest by annoying and although i don't like it i'm sure i wouldn't pay him any attention otherwise.Yes, I mean it. It took me two years two learn my best friend's name and of course she wasn't my best friend back then, but she was still my friend.<b><font color="red"> I think i called her Friend who hung out with so and so.</font></b></p>
